# LetsTesselate
Inspired by the tis100, LetsTesselate is an emulator for a fictional multicore system which is programmed in it's own
special, easy to learn but powerful assembly language based on redcode, the language of core wars. A powerful prefix-system combined with a tis100-like multicore layout is hopefully as interesting as fun to play with.
I will try to make the learning easy with some tutorial puzzles but all in all this will be more of an emulator than a game.
The entire emulator will be written in golang.
